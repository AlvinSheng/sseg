\title{Estimate the intensity at points using optimal bandwidth and within a type}
\usage{
intensity_optimal(x, bwv, verb = FALSE, ..., border = "local")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{point pattern, ppp object}

\item{bwv}{Vector of bandwidths to optimise over}

\item{verb}{verbosity}

\item{...}{passed on to \code{\link{intensity_optimal_bw}} from package 'intensitybw'}

\item{border}{see \code{\link{intensity_at_points}}}
}
\value{
A list with: a vector of intensities, one per point; the profiles; the best bandwidths.
}
\description{
Estimate the intensity at points using optimal bandwidth and within a type
}
\details{
First, we split the pattern per type.

Then we optimise the
kernel bandwidth using \code{\link{intensity_optimal_bw}}.

Then we re-estimate with border correction.

Finally, we concatenate the estimates to a vector.

Caution: For a big pattern with many types this will take time.
