\title{Dixon's 2-type contingency table tests}
\usage{
dixon(X, prepR = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Bivariate point pattern}

\item{prepR}{Preparation range, eases nearest neighbour computation for huge patterns.}
}
\description{
Computes the Dixon's test of segregation for a bivariate pattern using
the nearest neighbour contingency table.
}
\details{
The tests are an improvement on the Pielou's test of segregation. The test is defined only for two-type spatial pattern.
